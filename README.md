# Wearable Air Quality Sensor

A small wearable air quality sensor that connects to a phone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Monitors CO2, VOCs, NOx, temperature, and humidity.

## Features

- Real-time CO2 monitoring (400-5000 ppm)
- VOC and NOx index detection
- Temperature and humidity sensing
- BLE connectivity for mobile app
- OLED display for standalone viewing
- Portable battery power (1-2 day runtime)

## Hardware

### Core Components
- **MCU:** Seeed XIAO ESP32-C3 (RISC-V, BLE 5.0)
- **CO2 Sensor:** Adafruit SCD41 (NDIR CO2 + temp + humidity)
- **VOC Sensor:** Adafruit SGP41 (VOC Index + NOx Index)
- **Display:** SSD1306 OLED 0.96" 128x64 I2C
- **Battery:** LiPo 3.7V 500mAh
- **Total Cost:** ~$109

### I2C Address Map
- SCD41: 0x62
- SGP41: 0x59
- SSD1306: 0x3C

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install PlatformIO (VS Code extension or CLI):
   ```bash
   pip install platformio
   ```

2. For mobile app development:
   - React Native: Node.js + Expo CLI
   - OR Flutter: Flutter SDK

### Firmware Development

```bash
cd firmware
pio run -t upload      # Build and upload firmware
pio device monitor     # View serial output
```

### Development Phases

- **Phase 1:** ✅ Basic sensor reading (SCD41) - COMPLETE
- **Phase 2:** ✅ BLE communication with mobile app - COMPLETE
- **Phase 3:** Add VOC sensor (SGP41) - READY TO START
- **Phase 4:** Battery power system
- **Phase 5:** OLED display
- **Phase 6:** Enclosure design

### Current Status (Phase 2 Complete)

**Working Features:**
- ✅ SCD41 CO2/Temperature/Humidity sensor readings
- ✅ BLE advertising and communication
- ✅ React Native mobile app with Expo SDK 54
- ✅ Real-time data transmission over BLE
- ✅ Web demo deployed to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Web Bluetooth support (Android/Desktop browsers)
- ✅ Historical data charts and alerts
- ✅ Demo mode for testing without hardware
- ✅ Android development build ready

**Technology Stack:**
- Expo SDK 54.0.0
- React Native 0.81.5
- React 19.1.0
- Expo Router 6.0.21
- BLE Library: @sfourdrinier/react-native-ble-plx (RN 0.81 compatible)

**Live Demos:**
- 🌐 **Web App**: https://havamal-65.github.io/air-quality-sensor
  - ✅ Works on Android (Chrome/Edge) with real BLE
  - ✅ Works on Desktop with demo mode
  - ⚠️ iOS Safari: Demo mode only (Apple blocks Web Bluetooth)
- 📱 **Mobile (Expo Go)**: Run `npm start` and scan QR code
  - ✅ Full BLE support on iOS and Android
  - ⚠️ Requires computer running

**How to Use:**

1. **Web Browser (No Install Required)**
   - Open https://havamal-65.github.io/air-quality-sensor on Android Chrome/Edge
   - Tap "Connect Sensor" and select your AirSense device
   - Real-time data appears instantly

2. **Expo Go App (Development)**
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app
   - Full native BLE support

3. **Standalone App (Coming Soon)**
   - Build with EAS: `npx eas-cli build --platform ios/android`
   - Install via TestFlight (iOS) or APK (Android)
   - Works anywhere without computer

**Next Steps:**
- Build standalone iOS/Android apps with EAS
- Connect SGP41 VOC/NOx sensor (Phase 3)
- See `firmware/PHASE2-BLE-INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed setup

## Air Quality Thresholds

### CO2 Levels
| Level | Range (ppm) | Color | Action |
|-------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Excellent | <600 | Green | None |
| Good | 600-800 | Green | None |
| Moderate | 800-1000 | Yellow | Consider ventilation |
| Poor | 1000-1500 | Orange | Open windows |
| Bad | >1500 | Red | Ventilate immediately |

### VOC Index
| Level | Range | Color | Action |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Good | 0-150 | Green | None |
| Moderate | 150-250 | Yellow | Check for sources |
| Poor | 250-400 | Orange | Ventilate |
| Bad | >400 | Red | Remove source |
